# WIP Vue.js Basic Challenge

The idea is to create simple throw-away Vue.js apps in the next 2-3 weeks, learn Vue.js thoroughly and come up with 2-3 real apps.

Even if the apps/projects themselves are not useful, the skills I can gain from working on them are.

> It's still really difficult for me to put anything but perfect online and it hasn't changed since my [React](https://github.com/zsoltime/react-basic-challenge) and [JS game challenges](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge). The repos below are far from perfect so typing `git push` at the end of the day and making my code visible on a public repo still makes me feel bad ðŸ˜£
